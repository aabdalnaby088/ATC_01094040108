# Areeb Event Booking System 🎟️

This is a full-stack event booking system built with AI-assisted tools. It allows users to register, browse, and book events, while providing an admin panel for managing those events.

✅ I have successfully implemented **all required features** listed in the task, along with bonus features such as dark mode, multi-language support, responsive design, and image uploading. The backend and frontend are fully connected and deployed.
